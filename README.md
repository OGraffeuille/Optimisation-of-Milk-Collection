This folder contains the code for the set partitioning algorithm developed in Julia.

set_partitioning 2.0.jl - This file contains the code for the set partitioning algorithm. This is a three stage process detailed in the report. This file also contains functions to carry out the experiments detailed in the report. 

data 2.0.jl - This file contains the code that creates the parameters for the set_partitioning 2.0.jl script. This file gathers data from csv files in one of the data subfolders, and performs transformations on these to gather all the parameters that allows the set_partitioning script to run.

The three data subfolders each contain data representing a different problem instance of the milk collection problem. The data 2.0.jl script has a parameter which determines which of these. 

data - this contains the four problem instances gathered from McColl's Transport's data. This is the data upon which all results were gathered.

data_mini_snig & data_one_tour - these contain two small problem instances used to analyse results on a small scale, and debug various aspects of the code. 

output - this folder contains the outputed schedules of the set_partitioning script. Whenever a schedule is generated by this script, it creates two files, a beginning file and a trigger file. These contain information about the schedule in a format that is readable by our anylogic simulation, and allows us to validate and easily visualise our generated schedule. The julia_trigger file informs the simulation of how tanker routes start, while the julia_farms file informs the simulation of how tanker routes continue. This folder also contains experiments.xlsx, a file which contains the collated experimental results.
